The _bio3d-vision_ dataset collection's goal is to aggregate high-quality, large-scale 3D biological microscopy datasets whose analyses present challenging computer vision problems of great importance to advancing the state of microscopy.


The _bio3d-vision_ project is organized by [LCIMB](about-lcimb/), a part of [NIH/NIBIB](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/).

# Getting started

---

In addition to manual dataset downloads below, this project provides a `bio3d_vision` python package to simplify downloading and manipulating 3D microscopy images and labels. 

### Clone the repo

The `bio3d_vision` package can be cloned from [https://github.com/bio3d-vision/bio3d_vision](https://github.com/bio3d-vision/bio3d_vision). Add it to your system path or a project folder to use it. TODO: pip integration.

### Example: *platelet-em*

[Click here for an example](examples/example_data_prep.html) of using `bio3d_vision` to download the *platelet-em* dataset and load it into numpy for manipulation and windowing.
